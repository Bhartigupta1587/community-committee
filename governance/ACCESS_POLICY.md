# Account Access Policy

## Zoom & YouTube

Ask the Community Committee Chairperson for access to Zoom. The chairpersons of the TSC and Community Committee can grant access to project members so they can start YouTube streams for the meetings.

## LinkedIn Node.js Group

Any Community Committee member can become a group admin. Ask an existing admin for access. Existing admins should only add current [Community Committee members](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee#community-committee-members) to the list.

## General Rules That Apply to All Account Access

- The [Membership Expectations](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MemberExpectations.md) – specifically as they apply to project leadership – fully applies to this.
- Adding anyone who should not be added will be reviewed by the CommComm and could be grounds for immediate removal of access/CommComm membership.
